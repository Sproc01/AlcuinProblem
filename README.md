# AlcuinProblem
The program is divided in three files:
- The model definition and resolver(requires CPLEX)
- The graph generator
- A file that convert the output from the graph generator to a dat file that can be used as input for the MIP resolver
- A file that execute the model for all the graphs
- A file that create SLURM file for all the graphs
- A file for elaboration of the result
